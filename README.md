# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. I use these to customize the machines I use and keep the development experience consistent between them. 

### Management

I use [GNU Stow](https://www.stevenrbaker.com/tech/managing-dotfiles-with-gnu-stow.html) to assist in my dotfile management. GNU Stow is a symlink farm manager.
